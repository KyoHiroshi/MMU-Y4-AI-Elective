# 📦 MMU-Y4 AI Project – Automated Image Classification for Auctions

## 🔍 Project Overview
This repository contains research and experimental development work completed as part of the Artificial Intelligence (6G6Z0048) final-year elective at Manchester Metropolitan University. The project explores technical solutions to automate **image classification** in an online auction platform — enhancing usability, accuracy, and scalability of item categorization processes for sellers.

The work was conducted under a realistic startup simulation brief, involving multi-stakeholder requirements including ethical AI, cost-effectiveness, user experience, and computational constraints.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Manual image categorization by sellers on the platform was slow and error-prone, resulting in poor search results and reduced user satisfaction. The company required an **AI-based image classification system** that is:
- Accurate and scalable
- Cost-effective
- Transparent and fair (aligned with FAST AI principles)
- Adaptable to emerging global markets

## 🧪 Solution Approach

### ✅ Recommendation:
> **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)** combined with **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**

This approach strikes a balance between performance and feasibility, offering:
- Scalable classification performance
- Reduced training costs via dimensionality reduction (PCA)
- Flexibility to adapt across global item categories
- Support for ethical AI practices (bias mitigation, transparency)

## 📊 Techniques Explored
The report investigates a wide range of AI techniques including:
- **k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN)**
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** with Transfer Learning
- **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)**
- **Random Forests**
- **Autoencoders**
- **Unsupervised clustering (K-Means)**
- **Dimensionality reduction (PCA)**
- **Semi-supervised methods**

Each approach was evaluated against real business constraints and stakeholder expectations.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python (NumPy, Scikit-learn, Keras/TensorFlow)
- Image classification techniques
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA)
- Evaluation methods (k-Fold Cross-Validation, Stratified Sampling)

## 📈 Outcome
The ANN + PCA approach met nearly all of the company’s strategic and operational requirements, and laid the foundation for:
- An ethically robust AI pipeline
- Scalable categorization across user-uploaded images
- Enhanced user interface and top-10 prediction accuracy
- Responsible use of cloud-based infrastructure
